## Experience
I wrote my first "Hello World" program on a TRS-80 Model I at Brampton's *Shopper's World* under the watchful eye of a nervous Radio Shack salesman sometime in the late 1970s.  Subsequently, I did a little coding on a Commodore Pet in Grade 6 (so, maybe 1980?) and got into the craft in earnest in Grade 10 with an ICON computer.
