## Experience
I wrote my first "Hello World" program on a TRS-80 Model I at Brampton's *Shopper's World* under the watchful eye of a nervous Radio Shack salesman sometime in the late 1970s.  Subsequently, I did a little coding on a Commodore Pet in Grade 6 (so, maybe 1980?) and got into the craft in earnest in Grade 10 with an ICON computer.

I picked up a paper route and earned enough money to buy a TRS-80 Color Computer.  Unfortunately everyone else around me owned Commodore 64s or Apple IIs...

My first language was unstructured BASIC.  The kind with line numbers.  In highschool when I started on the ICONs we learned structured BASIC (no line numbers or GOTOs) and then Pascal.  I hated the language with it's finicky punctuation, but recall it fondly now.  In first year university I was taught Turing, an educational language developed by UofT.  I didn't do well in the course and ended up finishing university with a Bacheclor of Science in Zoology rather than Computer Science.
